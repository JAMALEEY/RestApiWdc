I add the DTO because so that my model layer become loosely coupled with the UI layer
concretly is used DTOs to let me transfer only the data that we need to share with the user interface and not the entire model object

The DTO Mapper :
ModelMapper utility its only useful when your DTO is almost similar to the concerned models (is not always the case)
